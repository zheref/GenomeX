## Why Expo?
The front-end platform the app should be targetting to is not specified and in order to display my skill set with JavaScript/TypeScript I called React should be a good bet since it's targetting industry class practices and I've used it recently myself in mobile projects with React Native. Expo will allow me to use this skill set to also deliver a Web App at the expense of certain _native_ limitations which are not relevant given the scope of the problem to solve.
